# Wordle

Let's keep the game trend going by building a "clone" of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) on the command line! You'll need to 

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to...

* Write a reliable game loop for command line applications.
* Use colors to create a more informative, engaging user experience on the command line.
* Organize behavior into relevant functions and modules.

## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least one Python script (.py) that allows the user to pay a Wordle-like game.

## I'm a Python Developer Mode

_Please fork this repo & complete your Wordle clone in your own copy._

[ ] First, read the New York Times' ["How to Play" link](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) to get a better sense of the rules (if you're not already very familiar).
[ ] Your app should guess a random 5-letter world from a collection of options.
[ ] Players should be able to guess words in an attempt to guess your app's guessed word.
[ ] The game should display all the most recent guesses from the player.
[ ] For each guess...
[ ] If the player's guess has the same letter(s) in the same position as the computer's word, those letters should be displayed in green.
[ ] If the player's guess has the same letter(s) in different positions than the computer's word, those letters should be displayed in yellow.
[ ] If the player's guess has letters that are not in the computer's word, those letters should be displayed in gray (or lowlighted another way)
[ ] The game should grant the player 6 guesses. If the player exceeds those guesses without getting the computer's word, the game restarts and the computer sleected another word.
[ ] If the player guesses the correct word, all letters should be displayed in green.
